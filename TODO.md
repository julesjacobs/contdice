- Add 0. to fill the empty spaces for mismatching discrete distributions
- Take max size of all int sizes -- Actually let's use the n#k types directly: those already have the right sizes without using a global max, which is suboptimal
- Install SPPL, create benchmark script

Later:
- Take care of higher-order functions (not supported in dice but supported in cdice)
